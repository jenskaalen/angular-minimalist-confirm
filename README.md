# angular2minimalist
Minimalistic angular2 starter with webpack 

"Just" a angular app, with gulp and webpack for building. Also includes lite-server for a quick startup. 
A lot of the starter packs are setup with testing, production and dev environment setup, etc. This starter pack is a lot leaner so you can add other dependencies later if you feel the need for it.  

## Installing  
1. Clone it
2. Run "npm install" in the directory 
3. Run "gulp" 
4. "npm run app"
